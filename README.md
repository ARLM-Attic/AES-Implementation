# AES-Implementation
AES C# implementation only supports 128-bit key so far.

This is a project I did for school with Kyle Bishop. It is our implementation of AES supporting 128 bit key length only.

I am working on implementing Galois Field calculations on the fly, but so far have only implemented using lookup tables.

Simply run the program, I have hard coded test values and keys in a byte[] array in Program.cs.
